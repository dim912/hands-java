/**
 * notify, wait and notifyAll are final native methods in Object class
 * These methods are used to communicate lock status of a resource
 * between threads.
 * notify => wakes up one thread. Thread selection depends on OS implementation
 * notifyAll => wakes ups all thread. Which thread process is OS dependent
 * wait => wait Infinitly till other method call notify/notifyAll or timeout => to wakeup current thread
 * => the thread which invoke this methods should have the object monitor
 * => else => java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown(run time)
 * Can be used to : implement producer/consumer problem.
 * Consumer thread are waiting for Objects in a Queue. and Producer put objects in a queue and notify waiting consume threads.
 */

/**
 * wait => release the lock and goto waiting state.
 * notify/notify all => notify all waiting threads to resume and look for the lock. Notify does not release the lock from current thread.
 *
 * Why wait/notify inside synchronized blocks
 * ------------------------------------------
 * wait() is called conditionally (if(condition) obj.wait())
 *  => But the condition is changed by an activity of another thread => because of that wait/notify methods should be called inside synchronized blocks.
 *
 * to avoid dead locks
 *  => Ex : In producer-consumer case => If synchronized is not used => There is a posibility consumer does not notice the last message (If the
 *  mesasge is entered to the queue by the producer after consumer checks the isEmpty() condition. => Then consumer goes to a deadLock.
 *  => because of wait() => thread does not wants to continuesly check the condition in a loop.

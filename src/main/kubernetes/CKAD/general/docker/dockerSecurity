#proxess isolation
container does not see things from host
containers share the kernel with host
processes of docker container is visible from host (ps command) with a differnt proceeses ID that how it is visible within container

#user https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities
root user within the container is not the root user of the host
by default the user within contaner is unpreviledged to access any devices on host (ex: can not run docker within container)
but previlege of container root user can be override
    # docker run --cap-add MAC_ADMIN ubuntu     #add previledges to the user within container
    # docker run --cap-drop MAC_ADMIN ubuntu    #drop previledges from docker user within contaienr
    # docker run --previledge ubuntu            #add all previledges to docekr user


docekr runs processes with root user within the container
within docker run command --user=10000 , can be used to run with a non root user
#or in docker file add USER userID


#checking logs in docker

#run the container in detach mode
docker run -d nginx

#to see the logs
docker log -f nginx

VPC    at region level  - Virtual Private Cloud ( private networking ). A virtual network.
Subnet at AZ level      - each AZ inside VPC has it own subnet
                        - private subnet - Ex: app server
                        - public subnet  - connects to internet - Ex: web server sit in public subnet. Or LB sits in public subnet
                                         - when subnet is connected to a routing table which point traffic to internet --> then subnet is a public subnet
                                         - in default VPC, all subnets are public subnets
Internet GW at region   - at region level - to connect public subnets to internet

PVC Peering - connecting one VPC to other privately ( PVCs can be owned by differnt orgs/accounts)

Transient GW - connecting many VPCs to each other and with on prime networks too ( star  topology )
             - on prime connect to transigent GW through direct connect or VPN

VPC GW         endpoints - connecting the S3/Dynmo DB to apps within the same region (otherwise traffic goes through internet)
VPC interface  endpoints -  apps can be connected to SQS/ SNS  / Lambda -

priavte link - expose the serveice via LB, cosumer VPC can connect to service provider though privateLink
             - VPC peering is VPC to VPC. so it is more broader and less secure. But private link is VPC to service

route53 - are pointed to LB

floud front - CDN

flow Logs - capture packets / can point to S3

site to site VPN -
                 - VPC side needs a VGW (Vertual gatewa)
                 - using this VGW can cnnect to the on prime router through VPN

direct connect
                 -
clinet to site VPN endpoint - conencting the PCs ( ex employess working from home ) directly to the VPC over public internet


section 4
---------

Global Level - route53, IAM, Billing
Region Level - S3, Dynmo DB, SNS, SQS
VPC level - ELB, VPN, IGW
AZ / Subnet level - EC2, RDS, EBS


0.0.0./0 --> All IP address to the hosts ( whole world )

private IP ranges
    -> 10.xxx.xxx.xxx                               - 10.0.0.0/8          -- big networks

all other IPs are public IPs

AWS  VPC CIDR range is == > /16 to /28
